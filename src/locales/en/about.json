    "intro": "I'm a frontend developer based in Stockholm, currently studying at <0>Hyper Island</0> and interning as a frontend developer at <0>Swirl</0>. At Swirl, I contribute to <1>Haus</1>, a financial health web app used by real customers, which has given me experience with production deployments and cross‑functional collaboration.",
    "skills": "I enjoy turning ideas into fast, accessible interfaces using <0>React</0>, <0>Next.js</0>, <0>TypeScript</0>, and modern UI libraries like <0>Tailwind CSS</0> and <0>shadcn/ui</0>. I've also built full‑stack projects with the <0>MERN stack</0> and <0>React + Strapi</0>, and I'm beginning to explore mobile UI development with <0>Flutter</0>.",
    "goals": "Right now, I'm looking for junior frontend roles where I can keep growing, ship features in production, and learn from a supportive team. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and staying curious about new tools, patterns, and web technologies."
